## 🧠 How the Frontend Should Get `user_id` from Supabase

In your system, `user_id` must come from the **Supabase Auth system**, because:

- Supabase automatically generates a **UUID** for each user when they sign up.
- This UUID is stored in the `auth.users` table and is used throughout your backend (`user_profiles.user_id`, `landlord_profile.user_id`, etc.).
- ⚠️ **Never generate UUIDs manually on the frontend** — they will not match any real authenticated user and can break authorization.

### ✅ Step-by-Step: Frontend Workflow Using `supabase-js`

> Here's how to properly sign up/log in and retrieve the authenticated user's ID (`user_id`).

---

### 🔐 1. Sign Up / Sign In

```ts
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: "user@example.com",
  password: "supersecurepassword"
});
```

Or for login:

```ts
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email: "user@example.com",
  password: "supersecurepassword"
});
```

---

### 🆔 2. Get the Current User and Extract `user_id`

After sign-in, you can retrieve the session’s user info:

```ts
const { data: { user }, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

if (user) {
  const userId = user.id; // ← This is the user_id you need to send to your API
}
```

This `user.id` is a UUID like:  
`2f850ed7-8138-4c7f-aaf4-cd4ba2b5c930`

---

### 📤 3. Use It When Creating a Profile

```ts
await fetch("/db/new/user", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    user_id: user.id,
    first_name: "Andrea",
    last_name: "López",
    ...
  })
});
```

---

### 🛡️ Bonus: Let the Backend Infer `user_id` from JWT

If you want **extra security**, you can:
- Send the **JWT access token** from Supabase in the `Authorization` header.
- Use Supabase RLS or backend decoding to retrieve `auth.uid()` securely.
- This means the frontend **doesn't have to send `user_id` manually** at all.

Let me know if you'd like to implement that next.

---

## ✅ Summary

- `user_id` is generated by Supabase Auth during sign-up
- Use `supabase.auth.getUser()` to get it after login
- Always use the real Auth-generated UUID, never a random one
- Optional: use JWT + RLS to make it fully secure and hidden from the frontend
